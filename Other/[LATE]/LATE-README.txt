Regarding the final project submisson.

* Visual Project Timeline
	- I wrote some text about the steps I took, but I do not have anything like a gantt chart of sorts.

* Technical drawings evidencing the project evolution including parts, assembly, exploded view, and animation
	- I had the standard technical drawing for my new model, and the one from my old model.
	- But that is all I had.

* Electronics
	- I did a virtual prototype. I handed in the bill of materials from before, and the new model's Fusion360 file.
	- However, there was no wiring done.

* Prototype Demo in the Pre-Recorded Video.
	- This has been submitted.

* Interactive Scene
	- See Unity project.

* QFD and Usability Assessment.
	- I did this as part of a prior lecture, so I renamed that file and include it.

* Written Report - PDF
	- The report still had comments in it, which was not supposed to happen.
	- A fixed version is in the '[LATE]' folder for this.

* Oral Presentation - Submitted
	- The video was submitted on time. The dropbox and the report both have a link to it.
	- Due to size limits the video file in the repo is 540p, while the YouTube upload is 1080p.
	- The video link is as follows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w67mH-MTEZw.
